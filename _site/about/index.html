<p>CLARA AI is a personal project I built for myself to help me build machine learning code for any task. I have meticulously created each step of the machine learning pipeline so that I can generate code easily thanks to a step-by-step guided tool with all the information in a single interface. I can ask CLARA AI any other question with the built-in chat using LLM generative AI and then add the answer to the code.</p>

<p>With Clara AI, I can build a machine learning code in a matter of hours, not days or weeks, all through a guided, step-by-step process.</p>

<h2 id="graduated-from-mines-paris-diplôme-dingénieur">Graduated from Mines Paris (Diplôme d’Ingénieur)</h2>

<p>Mines Paris is recognized as one of the premier engineering schools in France. I specialized in Artificial Intelligence and completed various courses in finance, economics, management, and virtual realities, among other subjects. Additionally, I hold a dual degree from the Lebanese University, where I earned an Engineer’s degree in Electrical, Electronics, and Telecommunications.</p>

<h2 id="international-internship-experiences">International Internship Experiences</h2>

<p>I have completed two international internships that have enriched my practical experience in the field and proves my ability to adapt to the environment in which I work.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/Switzerland.png" alt="drawing" width="20" /> The first Internship was with Swissgrid, a transmission system operator in Switzerland, where I designed and developed an AI solution utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. This solution effectively segmented alarm descriptions from the grid, significantly improving the management of substation alarms for operators in the control room.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/Norway.jpg" alt="drawing" width="20" /> My second internship was at a real estate startup in Norway, where the objective was to predict apartment prices in Oslo using AI. I took on comprehensive responsibilities throughout the project, from data acquisition and preprocessing to deploying the final solution. This experience enhanced my skills in end-to-end project management and deepened my understanding of applying AI in the real estate sector.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/blog/Lebanon.jpg" alt="drawing" width="20" /> I have also completed smaller internships in Lebanon, where I focused on customer segmentation and predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company . Additionally, I utilized Roboflow to develop AI solutions tailored for the banking sector.</p>

<h2 id="hackathon-enthusiast-and-winner">Hackathon Enthusiast and Winner</h2>

<ul>
  <li>I clinched the Special Jury Prize at the month-long innovation hackathon hosted by IBM in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS)! Our team delved into the fascinating realm of Artificial Intelligence, leveraging AWS’s generative AI to tackle a critical challenge: enhancing search engine capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I also won the Open Science Data Challenge 2023 hosted by EY, where I predicted the yield of rice crops using satellite data. I was one of the 3 finalists in the EY Data Challenge France!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Additionally, I won first prize in another challenge during a course at Mines Paris. The challenge involved precise segmentation of pre-detected aneurysms using real-life image data from a hospital.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
