CLARA AI is a personal project I built for myself to help me build machine learning code for any task. I have meticulously created each step of the machine learning pipeline so that I can generate code easily thanks to a step-by-step guided tool with all the information in a single interface. I can ask CLARA AI any other question with the built-in chat using LLM generative AI and then add the answer to the code.

## You are in Control

The Only AutoML with Full Control of Your Code:
CLARA AI is designed to save time for a data scientist. It is no black box, as you can see exactly how the ML pipeline is constructed and you will build it by yourself with a few clicks. No dependencies on many disparate libraries that increase complexity, maintenance costs, and technical debt in your projects.

## What you get with CLARA AI?

- **Dynamic Python Code Generation:** Generation of python machine learning code in real-time, providing instant visibility into the code being created.

- **Guided Step-by-Step Process:** Our platform offers clear, step-by-step guidance tailored to both data scientists and newcomers, ensuring a deeper understanding of algorithmic workings.
- **Comprehensible Code:** The generated code is readily comprehensible to any data scientist, enabling easy modification by your team without reliance on additional libraries. This puts the power back in your hands.
- **Expert Data Scientist Collaboration:** Benefit from the experience of a team of data scientists who have meticulously crafted each step available in the application, powered by AI-driven insights.
- **Fast development:** Guided by generative AI, the machine learning technology with code generated that works in terms of hours and not days or weeks.
- **Customizable Code:** In contrast to DraftifAI, other AutoML tools lack customization to specific business needs, requiring domain knowledge for method selection in imputation of missing data or feature extraction.

## How it works?

In this demo, we choose a regression task. First, we upload the data to be read and analyzed, then specify the target variable we want to predict. Clara AI generates the corresponding Python machine learning code in real-time. It also provides fully interactive visualizations to aid in data analysis.

Next, we proceed with preprocessing the data, such as feature extraction and data cleaning. Clara guides users step-by-step through each data preprocessing task, ensuring a deeper understanding of the underlying algorithms.

We then split the data into training and test sets and move to the model selection phase. Clara instantly generates personalized code for this step as well.

Additionally, users can ask Clara to generate code using a large language model (LLM). After receiving the response, we can integrate the generated code directly into the notebook.

Finally, after selecting the best model, users can either download the generated code or obtain the trained model directly.

## Better DATA Scientists

AI won't take the job of a data scientist. Data scientists that use AI wisely work better and faster. They must always be in control of what they do. This is how CLARA AI differs from anypother autoML tool. Jobs are changing not disappearing. We need to improve our job and add to them. Instead of fearing that AI will eliminate jobs, let's see how it helps us, as data scientist or not, to create new and better ones. CLARA AI helpes me with my work to create faster and complete code with no missing steps.
