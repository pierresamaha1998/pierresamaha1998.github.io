# About

<!--author-->

## Experienced Data Scientist at IBM

I contributed to a variety of sectors, including e-commerce, industry, public sector, finance, and telecommunications, engaging in numerous projects that leveraged advanced technologies. My work included:

- Computer Vision: Developed solutions for image processing, object detection, segmentation, and morphological mathematics to tackle complex visual perception challenges.

- Audio Processing: Created speech recognition applications on Android, incorporating keyword spotting functionalities akin to 'Hey Siri' or 'Alexa,' enhancing user interaction.

- Tabular Data: Implemented regression, clustering, and classification models tailored for various use cases, optimizing data-driven decision-making.

- LLM and NLP: Utilized Large Language Models (LLMs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and embeddings, through open-source models as well as IBM Watson Machine Learning and AWS.

- Data Management and DataOps: Conducted data analysis, managed migrations to DB2, and integrated Liquibase to ensure seamless data operations.

- Time Series Forecasting: Employed AROMA, LSTM, and Prophet models for accurate time series predictions, aiding in strategic planning and forecasting.

- Use Case Development: Explored various AI possibilities to devise innovative solutions for diverse business problems.

- Client Collaboration: Worked closely with clients to thoroughly understand their needs and objectives, translating them into effective design solutions that align with their business goals.

- Sustainability Initiatives: Contributed to decreasing CO2 emissions in IBM client projects by developing environmentally friendly AI solutions.

## Graduated from Mines Paris (Diplôme d'Ingénieur)

Mines Paris is recognized as one of the premier engineering schools in France. I specialized in Artificial Intelligence and completed various courses in finance, economics, management, and virtual realities, among other subjects. Additionally, I hold a dual degree from the Lebanese University, where I earned an Engineer's degree in Electrical, Electronics, and Telecommunications.

## International Internship Experience

I have completed two international internships that have enriched my practical experience in the field.

The first was with Swissgrid, a transmission system operator in Switzerland, where I designed and developed an AI solution utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Unsupervised Machine Learning techniques. This solution effectively segmented alarm descriptions from the grid, significantly improving the management of substation alarms for operators in the control room.

My second internship was at a real estate startup in Norway, where the objective was to predict apartment prices in Oslo using AI. I took on comprehensive responsibilities throughout the project, from data acquisition and preprocessing to deploying the final solution. This experience enhanced my skills in end-to-end project management and deepened my understanding of applying AI in the real estate sector.

I have also completed smaller internships in Lebanon, where I focused on customer segmentation for a telecommunications company and predicting customer churn. Additionally, I utilized Roboflow to develop AI solutions tailored for the banking sector.

## Certification and Personal Growth

I clinched the Special Jury Prize at the month-long innovation hackathon hosted by IBM in partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS)! Our team delved into the fascinating realm of Artificial Intelligence, leveraging AWS's generative AI to tackle a critical challenge: enhancing search engine capabilities.

## Just Markdown

Write all content with Markdown. **Hydejack** gives you [additional CSS classes](docs/writing.md) to stylize your content, without losing compatibility with other Jekyll themes.

## Just Markup

**Hydejack** boasts a plethora of modern JavaScript, but make no mistake: It's still a _plain old web page_ at its core. It works without JavaScript and you can even view it in a text-based browser like `w3m`:

## Syntax Highlighting

**Hydejack** features syntax highlighting, powered by [Rouge].

```html
<!-- file: `_includes/my-body.html` -->
<script type="module">
  document
    .querySelector("hy-push-state")
    .addEventListener("hy-push-state-load", () => {
      const supportsCodeHighlights = false; // TBD!!
    });
</script>
```

Code blocks can have a filename and a caption.

## Beautiful Math

They say math is beautiful — and with **Hydejack**'s [math support][math] it's guaranteed to also look beautiful:

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \phi(x,y) &= \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right) \\[2em]
            &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j)            \\[2em]
            &= (x_1, \ldots, x_n)
               \left(\begin{array}{ccc}
                 \phi(e_1, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
                 \vdots          & \ddots & \vdots         \\
                 \phi(e_n, e_1)  & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
               \end{array}\right)
               \left(\begin{array}{c}
                 y_1    \\
                 \vdots \\
                 y_n
               \end{array}\right)
\end{aligned}
$$
